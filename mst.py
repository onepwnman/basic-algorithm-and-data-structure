'''
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of 
the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all 
the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total
edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as 
small as possible.

If there are n vertices in the graph, then each spanning tree has n âˆ’ 1 edges.
MST is one of greedy algorithm which means it can be made of choosing best node
of current state. 
There is two algoritm's in MST which called Kruskal algorithm and Prim algoritm
If graph has a lots of edges, you can pick Prim algoritm otherwise Kruskal
algoritm is more efficient
